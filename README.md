# Credit_Card_Anomaly_Detection
---
In this project, we evaluate an imbalanced dataset of credit card frauds (with the target labels being authentic and fraudulent) and build an anomaly detection system to identify transactions that somewhat vary from the typical, authentic transactions. These observations are flagged as potentially fraudulent and put to further validation.
